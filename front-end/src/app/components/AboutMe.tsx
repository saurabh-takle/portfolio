                    From the bustling streets of Mumbai to the vibrant tech scene in New York, my journey in technology has been both diverse and dynamic. I earned my Bachelor&apos;s in Computer Science from Mumbai University, where I laid the foundation for a career driven by curiosity and problem-solving. Early on, I dipped my toes into the professional world through two enriching internshipsâ€”first as a Software Developer Intern, where I immersed myself in coding for 3 months, and then as a Data Analyst Intern for 9 months, unraveling the power of data to inform smart decisions.

                    Eager to expand my horizons, I immediately pursued a Master&apos;s degree at Pace University in New York, where I delved deeper into advanced technologies and innovative methodologies. My passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights led me to a contract role as a Data Engineer, a position I held for 1 year and 5 months. In this role, I engineered robust data pipelines, streamlined ETL processes, and turned complex datasets into clear, impactful solutions.

                    I&apos;m driven by a love for learning and a commitment to building technology that makes a difference. Whether I&apos;m writing code or exploring new tech trends, I&apos;m always looking for the next challenge to conquer.
